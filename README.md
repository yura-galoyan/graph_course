# graph_course
This project finds cover graphs edge in NP, taking edge list as input
## neccessary things
* gcc
* cmake(preferable)
## on Linux use bash build.sh to build project
```bash
bash build.sh
```

## input preconditions
edges in file must be written in this format
    u1 v1
    u2 v2
    u3 v3

if you want to show that vertex is disconnected from a graph write it connected to itself( 1 1)
vertexes start from 0, if maximum number of vertex is 5, that means there are 6 vertexes in graph
