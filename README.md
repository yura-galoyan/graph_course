This project finds graphs edge graphs in NP, taking edge list as input
## neccessary things
* gcc
* cmake(preferable)
## input preconditions
edges in file must be written in this format in edges.txt file,that is placed in same folder as out file\
    u1 v1\
    u2 v2\
    u3 v3\

if you want to show that vertex is disconnected from a graph write it connected to itself( 1 1)
vertexes start from 0, if maximum number of vertex is 5, that means there are 6 vertexes in graph
